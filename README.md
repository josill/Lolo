## Notes

Probably some unhandled bugs and crashes from different rss feeds and missing category and media content properties. I am not too familiar with rss feeds myself and I felt like handling all the edge cases wasn't going to prove my coding skills any further. I would've gladly demonstrated my .NET CORE skills but this project was way easier to impement using NextJS then Blazor.
